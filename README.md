# AI & Algorithmic Problem-Solving Projects

This repository contains implementations of various AI and algorithmic problems, including optimization techniques and data-driven predictions.

## ðŸ“Œ Contents

1. **N-Queen Problem (`Nqueen.ipynb`)**  
   - Implements the N-Queen problem using **backtracking**.  
   - Solves for N-sized chessboards by placing N queens safely.  

2. **Water Jug Problem (`waterjug.ipynb`)**  
   - Uses **Depth-First Search (DFS)** to solve the classic water jug problem.  
   - Finds a sequence of steps to measure an exact amount of water.  

3. **Titanic Survival Prediction (`S_Titanic.ipynb`)**  
   - Uses **Machine Learning (ML)** to predict passenger survival based on features.  
   - Includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification models.  

4. **House Price Prediction (`house_price_prediction.ipynb`)**  
   - Implements **Regression Models** to predict house prices based on various factors.  
   - Uses exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature selection.  

## ðŸš€ How to Use
- Open the `.ipynb` files in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.  
- Run the cells sequentially to see the results.  

## ðŸ”— Dependencies
Ensure you have the following installed:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn opencv-python
```
